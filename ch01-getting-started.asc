This chapter will be about getting started with Git. 
We will begin by explaining some background on Git, it's main components and workflow, then move on to how to set up Team Explorer to start working with Git. If you have already read "Getting Started" chapter of "Pro Git", you may want to skip ahead to <<first_time>>.
At the end of this chapter you should understand the basic Git toolset and you should be all set up to use it.
