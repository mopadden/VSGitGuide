=== Viewing the Commit History

After you have created several commits, or if you have cloned a repository with an existing commit history, you'll probably want to look back to see what has happened. We will look at a couple of ways you can review this history.

You can review the history of a single file by right-clicking on it in Solution Explorer and choosing *View History...*. 

.View History.

You can right-click and choose *Compare with previous...* or compare the versions in any two commits by selecting both, right-clicking and selecting *Compare...*.

.File Differences.
