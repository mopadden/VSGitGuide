== Introduction

Here is a quick summary of what the three chapters of this book will cover.

In *Chapter 1*, we're going to cover the Git basics: what Git is, the components and basic workflow, and how to set it up in Visual Studio.

In *Chapter 2*, we will go over basic Git usage -- how to use Git in the 80% of cases you'll encounter most often.
After reading this chapter, you should be able to clone a repository, see what has happened in the history of the project, modify files, and share changes.

*Chapter 3* is about the branching model in Git. This is the feature than enables Git to manage multiple parallel changes to a project with minimum fuss, and will revolutionise your development workflow and ability to develop collaboratively with colleagues.

*Further Topics* gives a brief introduction to further topics and where you can find and find out about more powerful Git tools.

Let's get started.
