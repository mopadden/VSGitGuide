==== Installing Git on Windows

An easy way to get Git installed is by installing GitHub Desktop.
The installer includes a command line version of Git as well as the GUI.
It also works well with PowerShell, and sets up solid credential caching and sane CRLF settings.(((PowerShell)))(((CRLF)))(((credential caching)))
We'll learn more about those things a little later, but suffice it to say they're things you want.
You can download this from the https://desktop.github.com[GitHub Desktop website].

The most official build is available for download on the Git website.
Just go to https://git-scm.com/download/win[] and the download will start automatically.
Note that this is a project called Git for Windows, which is separate from Git itself; for more information on it, go to https://gitforwindows.org[].

To get an automated installation you can use the https://chocolatey.org/packages/git[Git Chocolatey package].
Note that the Chocolatey package is community maintained.
