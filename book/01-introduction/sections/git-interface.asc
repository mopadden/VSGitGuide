=== Git Interface

There are a lot of different ways to use Git.
Visual Studio Team Explorer provides basic Git functionality while Git Extensions provides acceess to the full power of Git.

Most tutorials cover usage of Git on the command line, because most GUIs only implement a partial subset of Git functionality for simplicity, choice of graphical client is a matter of personal taste.

A good way to learn Git would be to open Terminal in macOS or Command Prompt or PowerShell in Windows and follow the examples in the ProGit book.
This tutorial illustrates the ProGit Book examples with clips of the Visual Studio user interface.
