=== Branch Management

(((branches, managing)))
Now that you've created, merged, and deleted some branches, let's look at some branch-management tools that will come in handy when you begin using branches all the time.

The Team Explorer *Branches* view does more than just create and delete branches.(((git commands, branch)))
Opening the view will give you a simple listing of your current branches:

.View Branches.

Notice `master` branch is in bold: this indicates the branch that you currently have checked out (i.e., the branch that `HEAD` points to).
This means that if you commit at this point, the `master` branch will be moved forward with your new work.

You can also filter the view to show branches names matching a particular pattern.

.View Filtered Branches.

You can delete unmerged branches that you don't want to keep, and branches on remote repositories.

[WARNING]
Visual Studio will first confirm if it is ok to continue before deleting a branch containing unmerged work or a remote branch.

.Delete Unmerged Branch.
