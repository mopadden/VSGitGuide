== Preface

This introduction combines sections of the first three chapters of "Pro Git" with Visual Studio screenshots, to help Visual Studio developers who are familiar with version control systems such as Source Safe and Subversion switch to Git.

Pro Git, by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, illustrates these and many more topics in an accessible way using the git command line. The full on-line version is available at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2.
